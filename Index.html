<h1>Jellyfish</h1>

<h2>Fun Facts</h2>

<p>Jellyfish are ancient, fascinating creatures that have existed for over 500 million years. They are 95% water, lack a brain, heart, and bones, and have no eyes, but use specialized cells to detect light. Some species glow in the dark, while others have incredibly long tentacles. Jellyfish use stinging cells to capture prey and defend against predators. Interestingly, certain species can revert to their juvenile form, potentially making them biologically immortal. Found in oceans worldwide, jellyfish thrive in diverse environments, from the Arctic to tropical seas.</p>
